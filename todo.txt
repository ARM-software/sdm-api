Secure Debug Manager API Todo
-----------------------------

- Revisit PO steps
- Look at l10n: .po file or manifest xml
- how to report errors to the user
- sync ptr *s

- userSelectedFilePath and selectCredential needs thought
    - is it flexible enough
    -

- selectCredential partner feedback:
    Potentially the selectCredential() api we understand that it allows to select one file.
    when in our case it would have to select
    the signature element:        Secure Element, Host, Local (non-secure).
    and the Debug type we expect (ConstDebug, ROTDebug, UnconstDebug)
